# STUDENT-DROPOUT-PREDICTION-USING-MACHINE-LEARNING
**Project Overview**
This project aims to predict student dropout and academic performance in higher education using machine learning techniques. By analyzing demographic, socioeconomic, and academic data, the model helps identify students at risk of dropping out, enabling timely intervention and support.

**Features**
Data preprocessing and feature engineering from multiple data sources
Classification models to predict student status: dropout, enrolled, or graduated
Use of machine learning algorithms like Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and XGBoost
Evaluation with accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification reports

**Technologies Used**
Python
Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation
Matplotlib, Seaborn for visualization
Scikit-learn for machine learning
XGBoost for boosted tree models

**How to Run**
Clone the repository
Install required libraries:
nginx
pip install -r requirements.txt
Load and preprocess the dataset
Train the machine learning models
Evaluate model performance

**Future Scope**
Incorporate more features such as psychological and behavioral data
Use deep learning models for improved prediction accuracy
Develop a real-time monitoring dashboard for academic advisors
